# ELE334 - Embedded Systems
This repository contains resources, code examples, and projects for the Embedded Systems (ELE334) course. The course covers the fundamentals of embedded systems, including:

Microcontroller Programming: Basics of programming microcontrollers, including GPIO, timers, and interrupts.
Peripherals: Working with embedded system peripherals such as ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converters), PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), and serial communication (UART, SPI, I2C).
Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS): Introduction to real-time systems and using RTOS to handle multitasking in embedded applications.
System Design: Techniques for designing reliable and efficient embedded systems with a focus on hardware-software integration.
Embedded C/C++: Programming embedded applications using C/C++, covering memory management and optimization for resource-constrained environments.
This repository provides a practical learning experience in embedded systems design and programming, supporting theoretical concepts with real-world examples and projects.
